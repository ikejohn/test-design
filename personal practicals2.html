  <h3>REMEMBER THAT THIS PROJECT MUST BE COMPLETED BEFORE NOON</h3>
  <p>Only the not serious students normally finish there assignments late.
    many of them found it  not interested to carryout there project at a given time.
    we can only try to help those students in any way we can help them to achieve a desirable result.
    we can do that by integrating them with a special programs like informatics.
    In olden days people normally respect their elders to a large extent.
    we can re-adjust our mindset about love any time we are in love.

    <h3>TIPS FOR A LOVING PEOPLE</h3>
    Before i dont really understand what it means to be in  love until i saw my very good friend
    who taught me programming and his fiancee. then i understood the meaning of love.
    many people that love is  about sexual satisfaction but that is not so. 
    we can dedicate our lives in helping others or nothing.

    <h3>WHERE CAN WE GO FROM HERE</h3>
    <p>Never give up on any difficult challenges in life because
      that is what define hard working people from others. 
      The only given opportunity we have here is to bend down and learn fast as possible. Software developers has one 
    thing in common which is sleepless night and frequent calls at all times.

        we here fore make all necessary provision for old people for better investment and donation at large.
        Many educated people in the society today are not contemplating the nature of coding. We can never underestimate the
        value we place on people until we spend time hearing from them. Lets come to think about that while are waiting
        for the proposals then we can think of helping people solve their needs on time. Many people want to make money
        by all means even to the point of killing other people. This is very ridiculous and therefore need
        urgent attention. we can decide today to be our brothers keeper at all time. This can be done by us stopping
        form of racism in the world at large. We should understand that every humans deserve freedom at various level
        of human to human association.
